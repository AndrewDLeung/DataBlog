## What We Celebrate

Here's a map of holidays!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)
```

```{r}
holidays_by_season <- readRDS("/Users/andrew/Desktop/data-science/projects/data-blog/data/blog1/holidays_by_season.rds")
```

```{r}
holiday_map <- leaflet(holidays_by_season) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(~longitude, 
             ~latitude,
             color = ~case_when(
               season == "Winter" ~ "blue",
               season == "Late Winter" ~ "darkblue",
               season == "Spring" ~ "green",
               season == "Late Spring" ~ "darkgreen",
               season == "Summer" ~ "orange",
               season == "Late Summer" ~ "darkorange",
               season == "Autumn" ~ "red",
               season == "Late Autumn" ~ "darkred",
               TRUE ~ "gray"
             ),
             radius = 6,
             label = ~lapply(paste(
               `Event Name`, 
               Location, 
               Description, sep = "<br>"), HTML),
             stroke = FALSE,
             fillOpacity = 0.8
             ) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron)
